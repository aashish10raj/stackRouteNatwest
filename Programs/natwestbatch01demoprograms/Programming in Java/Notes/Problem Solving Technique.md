   GIT
   ---
   - It is version control system used to track chnages in computer files.
   - Git's primary purpose is to manage any chnages made in one or more projects over a given period of a time.
   - It helps co-ordinate works among members of a project team and tracks progress over time.
   - It will also help both programming professional and Non-technical users by monitoring their project files.
   
   Working in Project
   ------------------
   Frontend technolgies ----------> Branch1 --------> Master Branch
   Backend Technologies ----------> Branch2 ---------> Master Branch
   
   Git Commands
   ------------
   git config --global user.name "User Name"
   git config --global user.email "User Email"
   
   
1) git init           ---> initialize your local repo in the current working directory
2) git add .        ----> adds all the file in the working directory to repo
   git add <filename>    -----> add a specific file to repo
3) git status
4) git commit -m -a "message"
5) git log  ---> display the logs of commits
6) git revert <hashcode of commit> ----> to rollback to a previous commit
7) git rm <filename>  to remove a file from repo
8a) git remote add origin <repo url>
8b) git push -u origin master   ---> push to a repo server 
    git push -u <source>  <destination>
 
9) git clone <url>

   Problem Solving Technique
   --------------------------
   
   Algorithm
   ----------
   - A step by step instruction given to a system to solve a particular problem.
   - Technique to solve a well defined problem.
   - Precise steps to solve a problem.
   - It is not a rule ----- Rules must be followed.
   
    Algorith + You can develop application using any technologies.
    
    - Problem
    - Input
    - Process(Method)
    - Output
    
    Algorithm follows ----> IPO Cycle
    
    Characteristics of an Algorithm
    -------------------------------
    - Finite Steps 
    - Each steps will specify an action to be performed.
    - Basic Operation -----> Input, Process,Output
    
   ### Preparing a Coffee
   
    Step1: Start the Algorithm
    Step2: Input Milk, Coffee Powder, Sugar
    Step3: Boil the Milk
    Step4: Add Coffee Powder
    Step5: Add Sugar
    Step6: Mixed it
    Step7: Coffee is ready
    step8: End the Algorithm
    
  ### Write an algorithm to accept two numbers and display the sum of two numbers.
  
  ```
  Step1: Start the Algorithm
  Step2: Accept First number and Second number
  Step3: Add both the numbers
  Step4: Display the sum
  Step5: End the Algorithm.
  
  ```
  Another Way
  -----------
  
  ### Write an algorithm to accept two numbers and display the sum of two numbers.
  ```
  Step1: Start the Algorithm
  Step2: Let A,B and C as Number
  Step3: Take Input in A,B
  Step4: Calculate C=A+B
  Step5: Display C
  Step6: End the Algorithm.
  
  ```
    
FlowChart
----------
- It is graphical representation of an algorithm.

Pseudocode:
-----------
- Description of steps in an algorithm.
- No syntax
- Language neutral

Algorithm/Flowchart
-------------------
- We don't have any data types.
- No Naming conventions

Data types:
-----------
Data - Raw material of a system.
- Form of the data you want to feed into a system.
- 2 types
  1. Numeric 
  2. Character
  
For Example:

Numeric nfirstNumber
Character name

Variable
---------
- It is named memory location where we can store value.

Pseudocode Structure:
---------------------

Begin
<Variable definition>
    Assign -> set a variable with given value(Assign nNum=1)
    Accept -> Read an Input
    Compute -> Process
    Display -> Output
    End
    

### Pseudocode to add two numbers

```
Begin
Numeric nNum1,nNum2,nSum
Display " Enter Number 1"
Accept nNum1
Display " Enter Number 2"
Accept nNum2
Compute nSum = nNum1+nNum2
Display "The Sum of two number is = "+nSum
End
```

### Conditional Construct - Check wether input is even or odd

```
Begin
Numeric nNum,nResult
Begin
Display'The Number is: "+nNum
End
Display "Enter the Number"
Accept nNum
Compute nResult=nNum % 2
if nResult==0 then
Display " The Number is Even "
Else
Display " The Number is Odd "
Endif
End

```
