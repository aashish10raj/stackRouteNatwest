# Polymorphism
---------------
Poly - many
Morph - forms

- When object is changing it's form according to a circumstances i.e. called Polymorphism.

Types of Polymorphism
----------------------
2 types

1. Static Polymorphism
----------------------
   - When object is changing it's form at the time of compilation is called Static Polymorphism.
   - There are 2 ways to implements.
     1. Method Overloading
        ------------------
        - Method with same name and different signatue.
        - Method Signature:
                           Number of Parameter
                           Type of Parameter
                           Order of Parameter
     2. Constructor Overloading
        - Constructor with same name and different parameter.
     
     Early Binding : when method is associating with object at the time of compilation is called Early Binding or Static Binding.
     --------------
     
2. Dynamic Polymorphism
------------------------
 - When object is changing its form at runtime is called Dynamic Ploymorphism.
 - We can implement dynamic polymorphism by using Method Overriding.
 
 Method Overriding
 -----------------
 - Method with same name and same signature.
 - The redefining of parent class method into a child class is called Method Overriding.
 
 Late Binding : when method is associating with object at runtime is called Late Binding or Dynamic Binding.
 
 instanceOf Operator
 -------------------
 - It is use to test wether object belongs to the particular class or not.
