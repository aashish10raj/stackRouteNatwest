Interface
----------
- It is a behavioral protocol which will provide common implementation for unrelated classes.
- By default all the variables are static and final.
- By default all the methods are public and abstract.
- We can use implements keyword.

For Example:
interface X{
int number=100; // static and final
void add(); // public and abstract
}
