Encapsulation:
--------------
- Means to enclose in a capsule.
- Wraps the internal working of java object.
- Hides the data variable from the user of the object.
- Enable methods to provide an explicit service to the user of the object but hides the implementation.

# Private Data and Public Interface
  - To hide implementation details:
    1. Declare all fields of class as a private.
    2. Declare all the methods as public
    
2 ways you can set the value
----------------------------
1. Setter Method
2. Constructor

String name;

// Setter Method  // Mutator
public void setName(String name){
this.name=name;
}

// Getter Method // Accessor

public String getName(){
return name;
}
