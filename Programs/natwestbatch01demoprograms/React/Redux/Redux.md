 # What is Redux ?
-------------------
- Redux is an open source predictable state container for JavaScript apps.
- It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments and are easy to test.
- You can use Redux together with React, or with any view library.

# Why use Redux with React ?
-----------------------------
- React is unidirectional.
- React follows one way data binding.
- Very difficult to maintain the state at application level without a state manager.
- Redux library centralizes the state management of the application.

# Building Blocks of Redux
---------------------------
1. Store 
2. Actions
3. Reducers

1. STORE. This is an object that can contain functions and other objects. ...
2. ACTIONS. Actions are also JavaScript objects but rather than describing how the app state changes, it describes what   
   happened. ...
3  REDUCERS. Now reducers describe how the app state changes.
